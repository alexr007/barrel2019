This application is used to maintain water pressure in a given range.  

System can operate in automatic and manual modes.

- automatic mode
    - the system maintains the pressure in a given range automatically.
    - when pressure reaches low threshold - pump will switch ON automatically.
    - when pressure reaches high threshold - pump will switch OFF automatically.
    - START (or 'select') button will start the pump manually. The pump will stop automatically once the high threshold will be reached.
    - STOP (or 'select') button will stop the pump manually. The pump will start automatically once the low threshold will be reached.
- manual mode
    - If low threshold equals high threshold, that means you are in the manual mode.
    - In this mode, the system doesn't check the current pressure. **Be careful**.
    - Only you switch the pump ON and OFF. **Be careful**.
    - START (or 'select') button will start the pump manually. No any sensors used to automatically stop the pump. 
    - STOP (or 'select') button will stop the pump manually. No any sensors used to automatically start the pump.

The system starts in **automatic** mode with thresholds **1.8** / **3.8** Pa
